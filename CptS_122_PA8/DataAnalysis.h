		//mCsvStream : ifstream

	//Member functions :
		//A function that opens data.csv // yes, it’s private, and must use mCsvStream to open the file
		//A function that reads one line from the file and splits the line into units, type, and transaction fields
		//A function that loops until all lines are read from the file; calls the function below, and then displays the current contents of both BSTs; use inOrderTraversal() to display the trees
		//A function that compares the transaction field and inserts the units and type into the appropriate tree(mTreeSold or mTreePurchased) // note with the way the data.csv file is organized the trees will be fairly balanced
		//A function that writes to the screen the trends we see in our tree; the function must display the type and number of units that are least purchased and sold, and the most purchased and sold
		
public:
		//runAnalysis(), which is the only public function in the class, aside from possibly a constructor and / or destructor; this function calls the other private functions
