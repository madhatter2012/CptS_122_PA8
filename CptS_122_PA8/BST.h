	//insert() // yes, it’s private, and it dynamically allocates a TransactionNode and inserts recursively in the correct subtree based on mUnits; should pass in a reference to a pointer (i.e. Node *& pT)
	//inOrderTraversal() // yes, once again it’s private to hide pointer information
	//inOrderTraversal(), which recursively visits and prints the contents(mData and mUnits) of each node in the tree in order; each node’s printData() should be called
		//contents should be printed on a separate line; must call the printData() function associated with the TransactionNode

		//findSmallest(), which returns a reference to a TransactionNode(i.e TransactionNode &)  with the smallest mUnits
		//findLargest(), which returns a reference to a TransactionNode with the largest mUnits
